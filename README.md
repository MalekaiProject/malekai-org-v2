# Remake of Malekai.org
Uses Vue.js, TailwindCSS and backed by GraphQL Crowfall API

Purpose of site will be a Crowpedia type directory of in game info that you can easily drill into data about races, classes, runes and powers using a set of filters backed by the Crowfall API data. Eventually we hope to have a talent tree builder as well and possibly some basic social features.
